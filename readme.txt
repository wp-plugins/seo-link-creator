== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this free? =

Yes.

Adding links to the current text selection has unlimited usage; adding multiple entities in a text block is limited to 100,000 words per month. 

= What links can be created? =

We map entities to their Wikipedia, Twitter, official web site, Google Maps,
stock exchanges, etc. More destinations are added all the time.

= What if the link I want is not shown? =

Just enter the link manually.

= What if the wrong entity (i.e., not the right meaning)? =

You can edit to select another meaning. If we don't have
the correct one, fallback to enter the link manually.

= How does it work? =

Adding a link with a selected expression performs a lookup in our database to
retrieve the link candidates for this entity. You select one. We insert the markup in the
document.

Adding links with a selected block of text first analyzes the text to pick-up 
its entities. Then it adds links where possible.
Selecting an added link shows the entity found, the link added, and the link alternatives.
Keep the created link, delete it, or replace it with another.

= What is schema.org markup? =

[schema.org](http://www.schema.org/) is HTML markup supported by the major search engines to
better interpret the content of the HTML page. The SEO Link
Creator plugin add this markup to remove any ambiguity (E.g., "Washington" can refer to
many different cities, persons, etc.). Using this markup reduces the chance
that someone will bounce off your page because off topic.
